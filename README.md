# AI Bot Agents in Python

AI bot agents were programmed in Python for this project.

Technologies used: LLaMA, CrewAI, Groq, and NumPy.

LLaMA: A large language model, often used for natural language processing tasks.

CrewAI: A tool designed for AI/ML workload optimization and deployment.

Groq: A specialized hardware platform for AI acceleration.

NumPy: A popular Python library used for numerical computations.
